# Personal Portfolio Page
My most ambicious project yet, my personal portfolio page. This project has four different pages: home page, about me page, projects page and contact me page. The project is completely responsive in all resolutions and was developed mobile first. It also has a responsive navbar made with pure Javascript. From this project, a potential client can know everything he needs to know about me and can see my main projects.
